# Bike Share Toronto Data Analysis

## Summary

This is a new short project I have been working on where I want to try and datamine some interesting statistics about Bike Share Toronto. One thing I have in mind is to see which stations are most likely to be full or empty and at what times. 

The code to grab and access live data is now running. Next step is to begin building a dataset over the course of at least a full week.
